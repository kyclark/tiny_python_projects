O! Say, can y'all see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleamin' -
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the clouds of the fight,
O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streamin'?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs burstin' in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;
O! say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
