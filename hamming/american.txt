I went to the theater last night with my neighbor and had a liter of beer, the color and flavor of which put us into such a good humor that we forgot our labors.  We set about to analyze our behavior, organize our thoughts, recognize our faults, catalog our merits, and generally have a dialog without pretense as a license to improve ourselves.
