I went to the theatre last night with my neighbour and had a litre of beer, the colour and flavour of which put us into such a good humour that we forgot our labours.  We set about to analyse our behaviour, organise our thoughts, recognise our faults, catalogue our merits, and generally have a dialogue without pretence as a licence to improve ourselves.
