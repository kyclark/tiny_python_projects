# Playful Python

> "The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it." - Dennis Ritchie

I believe you can learn serious things through silly games. I also think you will learn best by *doing*. This is a book of programming exercises. Each chapter includes a description of a program you should write with examples of how the program should work. Most importantly, each program includes tests so that you know if your program is working well enough. 

I won't necessarily show you beforehand how to write each program. I'll describe what the program should do and provide some discussion about how to write it. I'll also create an appendix with short examples of how to do things like how to use `argparse`, how to read/write from/to a file, how to process all the files in a directory, how to extract k-mers from a string, etc. I'll provide some building blocks, but I want you to figure out how to put the pieces together.

## Forking GitHub repo

First use the GitHub interface to "fork" this repository into your own account. Then do `git clone` of *your* repository to get a local copy. Inside that checkout, do:

````
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kyclark/playful_python.git 
````

This will allow you to `git pull upstream master` in order to get updates. When you create new files, `git add/commit/push` them to *your* repository. (Please do not create pull requests on *my* repository -- unless, of course, you have suggestions for improving my repo!).


## new.py

I provide some useful programs in the `bin` directory including one called `new.py` that will help you stub out new Python programs using the `argparse` module to parse the command line arguments and options for your programs. I recommend you start every new program with this program. For example, in the `article` directory the `README.md` wants you to create a program called `article.py`. You should do this:

````
$ cd article
$ new.py article
````

This will create a new file called `article.py` (that has been made executable with `chmod +x`, if your operating system supports that) that has example code for you to start writing your program. 

## $PATH

Your `$PATH` is a list of directories where your operating system will look for programs. To see what your `$PATH` looks like, do:

````
$ echo $PATH
````

Probably each directory is separated by a colon (`:`). *The order of the directories matters!* For instance, it's common to have more than one version of Python installed. When you type `python` on the command line, the directories in your `$PATH` are searched in order, and the first `python` found is the one that is used (and it's probably Python version 2!)

You could execute `new.py` by giving the full path to the program, e.g., `$HOME/work/playful_python/bin/new.py`, but that's really tedious. It's best to put `new.py` into one of the directories that is already in your `$PATH` like maybe `/usr/local/bin`. The problem is that you probably need administrator privileges to write to most of the directories that are in your `$PATH.`. If you are working on your laptop, this is probably not a problem, but if you are on a shared system, you probably won't be able to copy the program into your `$PATH` directories. 

An alternative is to alter your `$PATH` to include the directory where `new.py` is located. E.g., if `new.py` is in `$HOME/work/playful_python/bin/`, then add this directory to your `$PATH` -- probably by editing  `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` located in your `$HOME` directory (if you use `bash`). See the documentation for your shell of choice to understand how to edit and persist your `$PATH`.

For what it's worth, I always create a `$HOME/.local` directory for local installations of software I need, so I add `$HOME/.local/bin` to my `$PATH`. Then I copy programs like `new.py` there and they are available to me anywhere on the system.

## Testing your programs

Once you have stubbed out your new program, open it in your favorite editor and change the example arguments in `get_args` to suit the needs of your app, then add your code to `main` to accomplish the task described in the README. To run the test suite using `make`, you can type `make test` in the same directory as the `test.py` and `article.py` program. If your system does not have `make` or you just don't want to use it, type `pytest -v test.py`. 

Your goal is to pass all the tests. The tests are written in an order designed to guide you in how break the problem down, e.g., often a test will ask you to alter one bit of text from the command line, and this it will ask you to read and alter the text from a file. I would suggest you solve the tests in order.

# Outline

I aim to have 40-50 programs complete with specs, examples, inputs, and test suites. They won't necessarily have a specific order, but they will be grouped into easiest/harder/hardest categories. As many programs use common ideas (e.g., regular expressions, graphs, infinite loops), there will be an appendix section with explanations of how to explore those ideas. 

I have in mind a layout where each program gets four pages:

        1        2               3        4
    +--------+--------+      +--------+--------+
    |        |        |      |        |        |
    |        |        |      |        |        |
    |        |        |      |        |        |
    | illus/ | specs  |      |solution| notes  |
    | info   |        |      |        |        |
    |        |        |      |        |        |
    |        |        |      |        |        |
    +--------+--------+      +--------+--------+

1. If a short program, perhaps an illustration; if longer, maybe some background or hints.
2. The `README.md` information (specs, example output)
3. The `solution.py` contents
4. Annotation of the solution with comments on lines, sections

## Programs


The goal is to get the reader to become a *writer* -- to try to solve the problems. One technique in teaching is to first present a problem without showing how to solve it. Once the student engages with the problem, they find they want and need the object of the lesson. Each program is intended to flex some programming technique or idea like playing with lists or contemplating regular expressions or using dictionaries. By using `argparse` for the programs, we also cover validation of user input.

### Easiest

* **article**: Select "a" or "an" depending on the given argument
* **howler**: Uppercase input text so they YELL AT YOU LIKE "HOWLER" MESSAGES IN HARRY POTTER. (Could also be called "OWEN MEANY"?)
* **jump_the_five**: Numeric encryption based on "The Wire."
* **bottles_of_beer**: Produce the "Bottle of Beer on the Wall" song. Explores the basic idea of an algorithm and challenges the programmer to format strings.
* **picnic**: Write the picnic game. Uses input, lists.
* **apples_and_bananas**: Substitute vowels in text, e.g., "bananas" -> "bononos". While the concept is substitution of characters in a string which is actually trivial, it turns out there are many (at least 7) decent ways to accomplish this task!
* **gashlycrumb**: Create a morbid lookup table from text. Naturual use of dictionaries.
* **movie_reader**: Print text character-by-character with pauses like in the movies. How to read text by character, use STDOUT/flush, and pause the program.
* **palindromes**: Find palindromes in text. Reading input, manipulation of strings.
* **ransom_note**: Transform input text into "RaNSom cASe". Manipulation of text.
* **rhymer**: Produce rhyming "words" from input text. 
* **rock_paper_scissors**: Write Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Infinite loops, dictionaries.

### Harder

* **abuse**: Generate insults from lists of adjectives and nouns. Use of randomness, sampling, and lists.
* **bacronym**: Retrofit words onto acronyms. Use of randomness and dictionaries.
* **blackjack**: Play Blackjack (card game). Use of randomness, combinations, dictionaries.
* **family_tree**: Use GraphViz to visualize a family tree from text. Parsing text, creating graph structures, creating visual output.
* **gematria**: Calculate numeric values of words from characters. Manipulation of text, use of higher-order functions.
* **guess**: Write a number-guessing game. Use of randomness, validation/coercion of inputs, use of exceptions.
* **kentucky_fryer**: Turn text into Southern American English. Parsing, manipulation of text.
* **mad_libs**: TBD
* **markov_words**: Markov chain to generate words. Use of n-grams/k-mers, graphs, randomness, logging.
* **piggie**: Encode text in Pig Latin. Use of regular expressions, text manipulation.
* **sound**: Use Soundex to find rhyming words from a word list.
* **substring**: Write a game to guess words sharing a common substring. Dictionaries, k-mers/n-grams.
* **tictactoe**: Write a Tic-Tac-Toe game. Randomness, state.
* **twelve_days_of_christmas**: Produce the "12 Days of Christmas" song. Algorihtms, loops.
* **war**: Play the War card game. Combinations, randomness.
* **license_plates**: Explore how a regular expression engine works by creating alternate forms of license plates.

### Hardest

* **anagram**: Find anagrams of text. Combinations, permutations, dictionaries.
* **hangman**: Write a Hangman (word/letter-guessing game). Randomness, game state, infinite loops, user input, validation.
* **markov_chain**: Markov chain to generate text. N-grams at word level, parsing text, list manipulations.
* **morse**: Write a Morse encoder/decoder. Dictionaries, text manipulation.
* **rot13**: ROT13-encode input text. Lists, encryption.

## Discussion

Cf Appendices: argparse, Truthiness

As with all the solutions presented, this assumes you have stubbed the program with `new.py` and that you are using the `argparse` module. I suggest putting this logic into a separate function which here is called `get_args` and which I like to define first so that I can see right away when I'm reading the program what the program expects as input. On line 12, I set the `description` for the program that will be displayed with the help documentation. On line 15, I indicate that the program expects just one *positional* argument, no more, no less. Since it is a "word" that I expect, I called the argument `word` which is also how I will access the value on line 25. I use the `metavar` on line 15 to let the user know that this should be a string. 

The `get_args` function will `return` the result of parsing the command line arguments which I put into the variable `args` on line 24. I can now access the `word` by call `args.word`. Note the lack of parentheses -- it's not `args.word()` -- as this is not a function call. Think of it like a slot where the value lives. 

On line 26, we need to figure out whether the `article` should be `a` or `an`. We'll use a very simple rule that any word that has a first character that is a vowel should get `an` and otherwise we choose `a`. This obviously misses actual pronunciations like in American English we don't pronounce the "h" in "herb" and so actually say "an herb" whereas the British *do* pronounce the "h" and so would say "an herb". (Even more bizarre to me is that the British leave off the article entirely for the word "hospital" as in, "The Queen is in hospital!") Nor will we consider words where the initial `y` acts like a vowel.

We can access the first character of the `word` with `word[0]` which looks the same as how we access the first element of a list. Strings are really list of characters, so this isn't so far-fetched, but we do have to remember that Python, like so many programming languages, starts numbering at `0`, so we often talked about the first element of a list as the "zeroth" element.

To decide if the given word starts with a vowel, we ask is `word[0].lower() in  'aeiou'`. So, to unpack that, `word[0]` returns a one-character-long `str` type which has the method `.lower()` which we call using the parentheses. Without the parens, this would just be the *idea* of the function that returns a lowercased version of the string. Understand that the `word` remains unchanged. The function does not lowercase `word[0]`, it only *returns a lowercase version* of that character.

````
>>> word = 'APPLE'
>>> word
'APPLE'
>>> word[0].lower()
'a'
>>> word
'APPLE'
````

The `X in Y` form is a way to ask if element `X` is in the collection `Y`:

````
>>> 'a' in 'abc'
True
>>> 'foo' in ['foo', 'bar']
True
>>> 3 in range(5)
True
>>> 10 in range(3)
False
````

The `if` *expression* is different from an `if` *statement*. An expression returns a value, and a statement does not. The `if` expression must have an `else`, but the `if` statement does not have this requirement.  The first value is returned if the predicate (the bit after the `if`) evaluates to `True` in a Boolean context (cf. "Truthiness"), otherwise the last value is returned:

````
>>> 'Hooray!' if True else 'Shucks!'
'Hooray!'
````

The longer way to write this would have been:

````
article = ''
if word[0].lower() in 'aeiou':
    article = 'a'
else:
    article = 'an'
````

Or more succinctly:

````
article = 'an'
if word[0].lower() in 'aeiou':
    article = 'a'
````

# Chapter 2: Jump the Five

Write a program called `jump.py` that will encode any number using "jump-the-five" algorithm that selects as a replacement for a given number one that is opposite on a US telephone pad if you jump over the 5. The numbers 5 and 0 will exchange with each other. So, "1" jumps the 5 to become "9," "6" jumps the 5 to become "4," "5" becomes "0," etc.

````
   1  2  3
   4  5  6
   7  8  9
   #  0  *
````

Print a usage statement for `-h|--help` or if there are no arguments.

````
$ ./jump.py
usage: jump.py [-h] str
jump.py: error: the following arguments are required: str
$ ./jump.py -h
usage: jump.py [-h] str

Jump the Five

positional arguments:
  str         Input text

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
$ ./jump.py 555-1212
000-9898
$ ./jump.py 'Call 1-800-329-8044 today!'
Call 9-255-781-2566 today!
````

Hints: 

* The numbers can occur anywhere in the text, so I recommend you think of how you can process the input character-by-character. 
* To me, the most natural way to represent the subsitution table is in a `dict`.
* Read the documentation on Python's `str` class to see what you can do with a string. For instance, there is a `replace` method. Could you use that?

## Discussion

On line 15, we indicate the one positional argument our program expects which is some `text` which we can retrieve on line 25. It may seem like overkill to use `argparse` for such a simple program, but it handles the validation of the correct number and type of arguments as well as the generation of help documentation, so it's well worth the effort. Later problems will require much more complex arguments, so it's good to get used to this now.

I suggested you could represent the substitution table as a `dict` which is what I create on line 26. Each number `key` has its substitute as the `value` in the `dict`. Since there are only 10 numbers to encode, this is probably the easiest way to write this. Note that the numbers are written with quotes around them. They are being stored as `str` values, not `int`. This is because we will be reading from a `str`. If we stored them as `int` keys and values, we would have to coerce the `str` types using the `int` function:

````
>>> type('4')
<class 'str'>
>>> type(4)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(int('4'))
<class 'int'>
````

To process the `text` by individual character (`char`), we can use a `for` loop on line 29. Like in the `article` solution, I decided to use an `if` *expression* where I look to see if the `char` is `in` the `jumper` dictionary. In the `article`, you saw we asked if a character was in the string `'aeiou'` (which can also be thought of as a `list` of characters). Here when we ask if a `char` (which is a string) is `in` a `dict`, Python looks to see if there is a key in the dictionary with that value. So if `char` is `'4'`, then we will print `jumper['4']` which is `'6'`. If the `char` is not in `jumper` (meaning it's not a digit), then we print `char`.

Another way you could have solved this would be to use the `str.translate` method which needs a translation table that you can make with the `str.maketrans` method:

````
>>> s = 'Jenny = 867-5309'
>>> s.translate(str.maketrans(jumper))
'Jenny = 243-0751'
````

Note that you could *not* use `str.replace` to change each number in turn as you would first change `1` to `9` and then you'd get to the `9`s that were in the original string and the `9`s that you changed from `1`s and you'd change them back to `1`s!

# Chapter 3: Picnic

Write a Python program called `picnic.py` that accepts one or more positional arguments as the items to bring on a picnic. In response, print "You are bringing ..." where "..." should be replaced according to the number of items where:

1. If one item, just state, e.g., if `chips` then "You are bringing chips."
2. If two items, put "and" in between, e.g., if `chips soda` then "You are bringing chips and soda."
3. If three or more items, place commas between all the items INCLUDING BEFORE THE FINAL "and" BECAUSE WE USE THE OXFORD COMMA, e.g., if `chips soda cupcakes` then "You are bringing chips, soda, and cupcakes."

## Discussion

This program can accept a variable number of arguments which are all the same thing, so the most appropriate way to represent this with `argparse` is shown on lines 15-19 where we define an `item` agument with `nargs='+'` where `nargs` is the *number of arguments* and `'+'` means *one or more*. Remember, even if the user provides only one argument, you will still get a `list` with just one element.

We put the `items` into a variable on line 28. Note that I call it by the plural `items` because it's probably going to be more than one. Also, I call the variable something informative, not just `args` or something too generic. Lastly, I need to decide how to format the items. As in the article selector, I'm using an `if` *expression* rather than an `if` *statement that would look like this:

````
bringing = ''
if num == 1:
    bringing = items[0]
elif num == 2:
    bringing = ' and '.join(items)
else:
    bringing = ', '.join(items[:-1] + [ 'and ' + items[-1]]) 
````

But I chose to condense this down into a double `if` expression with the following form:

````
bringing = one_item if num == 1 else two_items if num == 2 else three_items
````

Finally to `print` the output, I'm using a format string where the `{}` indicates a placeholder for some value like so:

````
>>> 'I spy something {}!'.format('blue')
'I spy something blue!'
````

You can also put names inside the `{}` and pass in key/value pairs in any order:

````
>>> 'Give {person} the {thing}!'.format(thing='bread', person='Maggie')
'Give Maggie the bread!'
````

Depending on your version of Python, you may be able to use *f-strings*:

````
>>> color = 'blue'
>>> f'I spy something {color}!'
'I spy something blue!'
````

# Chapter 4: Howler

Write a Python program `howler.py` that will uppercase all the text from the command line or from a file. The program should also take a named option of `-o|--outfile` to write the output. The default output should be *standard out* (STDOUT).

## Discussion

Cf. Truthiness, File Handles

This is a deceptively simple program that demonstrates a couple of very important elements of file input and output. The `text` input might be a plain string that you should uppercase or it might be the name of a file. This pattern will come up repeatedly in this book, so commit these lines to memory:

````
if os.path.isfile(text):
    text = open(text).read().rstrip()
````

The first line looks on the file system to see if there is a file with the name in `text`. If that returns `True`, then we can safely `open(file)` to get a *file handle* which has a *method* called `read` which will return *all the contents* of the file. This is usually safe, but be careful if you write a program that could potentially read gigantic files. For instance, in bioinformatics we regularly deal with files with sizes in the 10s to 100s of gigabytes!

The result of `open(file).read()` is a `str` which itself has a *method* called `rstrip` that will return a copy of the string *stripped* of the whitespace off the *right* side of the string. The longer way to write the above would be:

````
if os.path.isfile(text):
    fh = open(text)
    text = fh.read()
    text = text.rstrip()
````

On line 39, we decide where to put the output of our program. The `if` expression will open `out_file` for writing text if `out_file` has been defined. The default value for `out_file` is the empty string which is effectively `False` when evaluated in a Boolean content. Unless the user provides a value, the output file handle `out_fh` will be `sys.stdout`. 

To get uppercase, we can use the `text.upper` method. You can either `out_fh.write` this new text or use `print(..., file=...)`, noting which needs a newline and which does not. You can use `fh.close()` to close the file handle, but it's not entirely necessary as the program immediately ends after this. Still, it's good practice to close your file handles.

# Chapter 5: Apples and Bananas

Perhaps you remember the children's song "Apples and Bananas"?

    I like to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas
    I like to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas

    I like to ate, ate, ate ay-ples and ba-nay-nays

    I like to eat, eat, eat ee-ples and bee-nee-nees
    I like to eat, eat, eat ee-ples and bee-nee-nees

Write a Python program called `apples.py` that will turn all the vowels in some given text in a single positional argument into just one `-v|--vowel` (default `a`) like this song. It should complain if the `--vowel` argument isn't a single, lowercase vowel (hint, see `choices` in the `argparse` documentation). If the given text argument is a file, read the text from the file. Replace all vowels with the given vowel, both lower- and uppercase.

````

# Chapter 6: Bottles of Beer Song

Write a Python program called `bottles.py` that takes a single option `-n|--num_bottles` which is an positive integer (default 10) and prints the "<N> bottles of beer on the wall song." If the `-n` argument is less than 1, die with "N (<N>) must be a positive integer". The program should also respond to `-h|--help` with a usage statement.

I'd encourage you to think about the program as a formal algorithm. Read the introduction to Jeff Erickson's book _Algorithms_ available here:

* http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/#book
* http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/book/00-intro.pdf


You are going to need to count down, so you'll need to consider how to do that. First, let's examine a list and see how it can be sorted and reversed. We've already used the `sorted` *function*, but we haven't really talked about the `list` class's `sort` *method*. Note that the former does not mutate the list itself:

````
>>> a = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
>>> sorted(a)
['bar', 'baz', 'foo']
>>> a
['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
````

But the `sort` method does:

````
>>> a.sort()
>>> a
['bar', 'baz', 'foo']
````

Also, note what is returned by `sort`:

````
>>> type(a.sort())
<type 'NoneType'>
````

So if you did this, you'd destroy your data:

````
>>> a = a.sort()
>>> a
````

As with `sort`/`sorted`, so it goes with `reverse`/`reversed`. The past participle version *returns a new copy of the data without affecting the original* and is therefore the safest bet to use:

````
>>> a = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
>>> a
['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
>>> reversed(a)
<listreverseiterator object at 0x10f0d61d0>
>>> list(reversed(a))
['baz', 'bar', 'foo']
>>> a
['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
````

Compare with:

````
>>> a.reverse()
>>> a
['baz', 'bar', 'foo']
````

Given that and your knowledge of how `range` works, can you figure out how to count down, say, from 10 to 1?

````

# Chapter 14: Bacronym

Write a Python program called `bacronym.py` that takes a string like "FBI" and retrofits some `-n|--number` (default `5`) of acronyms by reading a `-w|--wordlist` argument (defualt `/usr/share/dict/words`), skipping over words to `-e|--exclude` (default `a, an, the`) and randomly selecting words that start with each of the letters. Be sure to include a `-s|--seed` argument (default `None`) to pass to `random.seed` for the test suite.

# Chapter 15: Workout Of (the) Day (WOD)

Write a Python program called `wod.py` that will create a Workout Of (the) Day (WOD) from a list of exercises provided in CSV format (default `wod.csv`). Accept a `-n|--num_exercises` argument (default `4`) to determine the sample size from your exercise list. Also accept a `-e|--easy` flag to indicate that the reps should be cut in half. Finally accept a `-s|--seed` argument to pass to `random.seed` for testing purposes. You should use the `tabulate` module to format the output as expected.

The input file should be comma-separated values with headers for "exercise" and "reps," e.g.:

````
$ tablify.py wod.csv
+---------------+--------+
| exercise      | reps   |
|---------------+--------|
| Burpees       | 20-50  |
| Situps        | 40-100 |
| Pushups       | 25-75  |
| Squats        | 20-50  |
| Pullups       | 10-30  |
| HSPU          | 5-20   |
| Lunges        | 20-40  |
| Plank         | 30-60  |
| Jumprope      | 50-100 |
| Jumping Jacks | 25-75  |
| Crunches      | 20-30  |
| Dips          | 10-30  |
+---------------+--------+
````

You should use the range of reps to choose a random integer value in that range.

````
$ ./wod.py -h
usage: wod.py [-h] [-f str] [-s int] [-n int] [-e]

Create Workout Of (the) Day (WOD)

  -s int, --seed int    Random seed (default: None)
  -n int, --num_exercises int
                        Number of exercises (default: 4)
  -e, --easy            Make it easy (default: False)
$ ./wod.py

Flapping Leg Raises       17
````

Hints:

* Use the `csv` module's `DictReader` to read the input CSV files
* Break the `reps` field on the `-` character, coerce the low/high values to `int` values, and then use the `random` module to choose a random integer in that range. Also see if the `random` module can help you sample some exercises.
* Read the docs on the `tabulate` module to figure out to get it to print your data

## Discussion

As usual, I start with my `get_args` first to define what the program expects. Most important is a `file` which is not required since it has a `default` value of the `wod.csv` file, so I make it an optional named argument. I use the `type=argparse.FileType('r')` so I can offload the validation of the argument to `argparse`. The `--seed` and `--num_exercises` options must to be `type=int`, and the `--easy` option is a `True`/`False` flag.

### Reading the WOD file

Since I know I will return a `list` of exercises and low/high ranges, I first set `exercises = []`. I recommended you use the `csv.DictReader` module to parse the CSV files into a list of dictionaries that represent each rows values merged with the column names in the first row. If the file looks like this:

````
$ head -3 wod.csv
exercise,reps
Burpees,20-50
Situps,40-100
````

You can read it like so:

````
>>> import csv
>>> fh = open('wod.csv')
>>> rows = list(csv.DictReader(fh, delimiter=','))
>>> rows[0]
OrderedDict([('exercise', 'Burpees'), ('reps', '20-50')])
````

On line 55-58, I iterate the rows, `split` the `reps` values like `20-50` into a `low` and `high` values, coerce them into `int` values. I want to `return` a `list` of tuples containing the exercise name along with the minimum and maximum reps.

For the purposes of this exercise, you can assume the CSV files you are given will have the correct headers and the reps can be safely converted. 

### Choosing the exercises

Before I use the `random` module, I need to be sure to set the `random.seed` with any input from the user. The output will be formatted using the `tabulate` module which wants the data as a single `list` of rows to format, so I first create a `table` to hold the chosen exercises and reps. Then I get the workout options and reps from the file (line 69) which looks like this:

````
>>> from pprint import pprint as pp
>>> pp(exercises)
[('Burpees', 20, 50),
 ('Situps', 40, 100),
 ('Pushups', 25, 75),
 ('Squats', 20, 50),
 ('Pullups', 10, 30),
 ('HSPU', 5, 20),
 ('Lunges', 20, 40),
 ('Plank', 30, 60),
 ('Jumprope', 50, 100),
 ('Jumping Jacks', 25, 75),
 ('Crunches', 20, 30),
 ('Dips', 10, 30)]
````

and can then then use `random.sample` to select some `k` number given by the user from the `exercises`:

````
>>> import random
>>> random.sample(exercises, 3)
[('Dips', 10, 30), ('Jumprope', 50, 100), ('Lunges', 20, 40)]
````

The sampling returns a `list` from `exercises` which holds tuples with three values each, so I can iterate over those tuples and unpack them all on line 72. If `args.easy` is `True`, then I halve the `low` and `high` values. 

````
>>> random.randint(5, 10)
6
>>> random.randint(5, 10)
8
````

### Printing the table

Then I can `append` to the `table` a new tuple containing the `name` of the exercise and a `randint` (random integer) selected from the range given by `low` and `high`. Finally I can `print` the result of having the `tabulate` module create a text table using the given `headers`. You can explore the documentation of the `tabulate` module to discover the many options the module has.

# Chapter 16: Blackjack 

Write a Python program called `blackjack.py` that plays an abbreviated game of Blackjack. You will need to `import random` to get random cards from a deck you will construct, and so your program will need to accept a `-s|--seed` that will set `random.seed()` with the value that is passed in so that the test suite will work. The other arguments you will accept are two flags (Boolean values) of `-p|--player_hits` and `-d|--dealer_hits`. As usual, you will also have a `-h|--help` option for usage statement.

To play the game, the user will run the program and will see a display of what cards the dealer has (noted "D") and what cards the player has (noted "P") along with a sum of the values of the cards. In Blackjack, number cards are worth their value, face cards are worth 10, and the Ace will be worth 1 for our game (though in the real game it can alternate between 1 and 11).

To create your deck of cards, you will need to use the Unicode symbols for the suites ( ♥ ♠ ♣ ♦ ) [which won't display in the PDF, so consult the Markdown file].

Combine these with the numbers 2-10 and the letters "A", "J", "Q," and "K" (hint: look at `itertools.product`). Because your game will use randomness, you will need to sort your deck and then use the `random.shuffle` method so that your cards will be in the correct order to pass the tests.

When you make the initial deal, keep in mind how cards are actually dealt -- first one card to each of the players, then one to the dealer, then the players, then the dealer, etc. You might be tempted to use `random.choice` or something like that to select your cards, but you need to keep in mind that you are modeling an actual deck and so selected cards should no longer be present in the deck. If the `-p|--player_htis` flag is present, deal an additional card to the player; likewise with the `-d|--dealer_hits` flag.

After displaying the hands, the code should:

1. Check if the player has more than 21; if so, print 'Player busts! You lose, loser!' and exit(0)
2. Check if the dealer has more than 21; if so, print 'Dealer busts.' and exit(0)
3. Check if the player has exactly 21; if so, print 'Player wins. You probably cheated.' and exit(0)
4. Check if the dealer has exactly 21; if so, print 'Dealer wins!' and exit(0)
5. If the either the dealer or the player has less than 18, you should indicate "X should hit."

NB: Look at the Markdown format to see the actual output as the suites won't display in the PDF version!

````
$ ./blackjack.py
D [11]: ♠J ♥A
P [18]: ♦8 ♠10
Dealer should hit.
$ ./blackjack.py
D [13]: ♥3 ♦J
P [16]: ♥6 ♦10
Dealer should hit.
Player should hit.
$ ./blackjack.py -s 5
D [ 5]: ♣4 ♣A
P [19]: ♦10 ♦9
Dealer should hit.
$ ./blackjack.py -s 3 -p
D [19]: ♥K ♠9
P [22]: ♣3 ♥9 ♣J
Player busts! You lose, loser!
$ ./blackjack.py -s 15 -p
D [19]: ♠10 ♦9
P [21]: ♣10 ♥8 ♠3
Player wins. You probably cheated.

# Chapter 17: Family Tree

Write a program called `tree.py` that will take an input file as a single positional argument and produce a graph of the family tree described therein. The file can have only three kinds of statements:

1. `INITIALS = Full Name`
2. `person1 married person2`
3. `person1 and person2 begat child1[, child2...]`

Use the `graphviz` module to generate a graph like the `kyc.gv.pdf` included here that was generated from the following input:

````
$ cat tudor.txt
H7 = Henry VII
EOY = Elizabeth of York
H8 = Henry VIII
COA = Catherine of Aragon
AB = Anne Boleyn
JS = Jane Seymour
AOC = Anne of Cleves
CH = Catherine Howard
CP = Catherine Parr
HDC = Henry, Duke of Cornwall
M1 = Mary I
E1 = Elizabeth I
E6 = Edward VI

H7 married EOY
H7 and EOY begat H8
H8 married COA
H8 married AB
H8 married JS
H8 married AOC
H8 married CH
H8 married CP
H8 and COA begat HDC, M1
H8 and AB begat E1
H8 and JS begat E6
$ ./tree.py tudor.txt
Done, see output in "tudor.txt.gv".

# Chapter 18: Gematria

Write a Python program called `gematria.py` 

Gematria is a system for assigning a number to a word by summing the numeric values of each of the letters as defined by the Mispar godol (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria). For English characters, we can use the ASCII table (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). It is not necessary, however, to encode this table in our program as Python provides the `ord` function to convert a character to its "ordinal" (order in the ASCII table) value as well as the `chr` function to convert a number to its "character."


````
>>> ord('A')
65
>>> ord('a')
97
>>> chr(88)
'X'
>>> chr(112)
'p'
````

To implement an ASCII version of gematria in Python, we need to turn each letter into a number and add them all together.  So, to start, note that Python can use a `for` loop to cycle through all the members of a list (in order):


````
>>> for char in ['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']:
...     print(ord(char))
...
112
121
116
104
111
110
````

Now you just need to `sum` those up for each word!

````

gematria.py: error: the following arguments are required: str
$ ./gematria.py -h

# Chapter 19: Histogram

Write a Python program called `histy.py` that takes a single positional argument that may be plain text or the name of a file to read for the text. Count the frequency of each character (not spaces) and print a histogram of the data. By default, you should order the histogram by the characters but include `-f|--frequency_sort` option to sort by the frequency (in descending order). Also include a `-c|--character` option (default `|`) to represent a mark in the histogram, a `-m|--minimum` option (default `1`) to include a character in the output, a `-w|--width` option (default `70`) to limit the size of the histogram, and a `-i|--case_insensitive` flag to force all input to uppercase.

# Chapter 20: Guessing Game

Write a Python program called `guess.py` that plays a guessing game for a number between a `-m|--min` and `-x|--max` value (default 1 and 50, respectively) with a limited number of `-g|--guesses` (default 5). Complain if either `--min` or `--guesses` is less than 1. Accept a `-s|--seed` for `random.seed`. If the user guesses something that is not a number, complain about it.

The game is intended to actually be interactive, which makes it difficult to test. Here is how it should look in interactive mode:

````
$ ./guess.py -s 1
Guess a number between 1 and 50 (q to quit): 25
"25" is too high.
Guess a number between 1 and 50 (q to quit): foo
"foo" is not a number.
Guess a number between 1 and 50 (q to quit): 12
"12" is too high.
Guess a number between 1 and 50 (q to quit): 6
"6" is too low.
Guess a number between 1 and 50 (q to quit): 9
"9" is correct. You win!
````

Because I want to be able to write a test for this, I also want the program to accept an `-i|--inputs` option so that the game can also be played exactly the same but without the prompts for input:

````
$ ./guess.py -s 1 -i 25 foo 12 6 9
"25" is too high.
"foo" is not a number.
"12" is too high.
"6" is too low.
"9" is correct. You win!
````

You should be able to handle this in your inifinite game loop.

A pair of star-cross'd pistons take their life;
Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
Doth with their stick shift bury their parents' strife.
The fearful passage of their furious love,
And the continuance of their parents' rage,
Which, but their children's end, nought could accelerate,
Is now the 42 hours' traffic of our stage;
The which if you with patient foot attend,
What here shall hammer, our toil shall strive to mend.

Owing to the vagaries of the typefaces chosen by different states as well as the wear of the plates themselves, it would seem to me that people might easily confuse certain letters and numbers on plates. In the above example, `ABC1234`, the number `1` might look like the letter `I`, so the plate could be `ABD1234` or `ABCI234`. Granted, most license plates follow a pattern of using only letters in some spots and numbers in others, e.g., 3 letters plus 4 numbers, but I want to focus on all possibilities in this problem both because it makes the problem a bit easier and also because it doesn't have to worry about how each state formats their plates. Additionally, I want to account for customized plates that do not follow any pattern and might use any combination of characters.

I represented the above confusion table as a list of tuples. At first I though I might use a dictionary, but there is a problem when three characters are involved, e.g., `0`, `O`, and `Q`. I iterate through each character in the provided plate and decide if the character exists in any of the tuples. If so, I represent that position in the regular expression as a choice; if not, it is just the character. 

If you think about a regular expression as a graph, it starts with the first character, e.g., `A` which must be followed by `B` which must be followed by `C` which must be followed by either a `1` or an `I` which must be followed by a `2` or a `7`, etc.

                     1        2        3
    A -> B -> C -> <   > -> <   > -> <   > -> 4
                     I        7        E

In creating all the possible plates from your regular expression, you are making concrete what the regular expression is, well, ... expressing. I find `itertools.product` to be just the ticket for creating all those possibilites, which must be sorted for the sake of the test.

# Chapter 24: Markov Chains for Words

Write a Python program called `markov.py` that uses the Markov chain algorithm to generate new words from a set of training files. The program should take one or more positional arguments which are files that you read, word-by-word, and note the options of letters after a given `-k|--kmer_size` (default `2`) grouping of letters. E.g., in the word "alabama" with `k=1`, the frequency table will look like:

````
a = l, b, m
l = a
b = a
m = a
````

That is, given this training set, if you started with `l` you could only choose an `a`, but if you have `a` then you could choose `l`, `b`, or `m`.

The program should generate `-n|--num_words` words (default `10`), each a random size between `k` + 2 and a `-m|--max_word` size (default `12`). Be sure to accept `-s|--seed` to pass to `random.seed`. My solution also takes a `-d|--debug` flag that will emit debug messages to `.log` for you to inspect.

Chose the best words and create definitions for them:

* yulcogicism: the study of Christmas gnostics
* umjamp: skateboarding trick
* callots: insignia of officers in Greek army
* urchenev: fungal growth found under cobblestones

# Chapter 25: Pig Latin

Write a Python program named `piggie.py` that takes one or more file names as positional arguments and converts all the words in them into "Pig Latin" (see rules below). Write the output to a directory given with the flags `-o|--outdir` (default `out-yay`) using the same basename as the input file, e.g., `input/foo.txt` would be written to `out-yay/foo.txt`. 

if a file argument names a non-existent file, print a warning to STDERR and skip that file. If the output directory does not exist, create it.

To create "Pig Latin":

1. If the word begins with consonants, e.g., "k" or "ch", move them to the end of the word and append "ay" so that "mouse" becomes "ouse-may" and "chair" becomes "air-chay."
2. If the word begins with a vowel, simple append "-yay" to the end, so "apple" is "apple-yay."

Write a Python program called `rhymer.py` that uses the Soundex algorithm/module to find words that rhyme with a given input word. When comparing words, it would be best to discount any leading consonants, e.g., the words "listen" and "glisten" rhyme but only if you compare the "isten" part. The program should take an optional `-w|--wordlist` argument (default `/usr/share/dict/words`) for the comparisons.

Write a Python program called `sub.py` that plays a guessing game where you read a `-f|--file` input (default `/usr/share/dict/words`) and use a given `-k|--ksize` to find all the words grouped by their shared kmers. Remove any kmers where the number of words is fewer than `-m|--min_words`. Also accept a `-s|--seed` for `random.seed` for testing purposes. Prompt the user to guess a word for a randomly chosen kmer. If their guess is not present in the shared list, taunt them mercilessly. If their guess is present, affirm their worth and prompt to guess again. Allow them to use `!` to quit and `?` to be provided a hint (a word from the list). For both successful guesses and hints, remove the word from the shared list. When they have quit or exhausted the list, quit play. At the end of the game, report the number of found words.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f str, --file str    Input file (default: /usr/share/dict/words)
  -s int, --seed int    Random seed (default: None)
  -m int, --min_words int
                        Minimum number of words for a given kmer (default: 3)
  -k int, --ksize int   Size of k (default: 4)
$ ./sub.py
Name a word that contains "slak" [!=quit, ?=hint] (10 left) slake
Totes! "slake" is found!
Name a word that contains "slak" [!=quit, ?=hint] (9 left) ?
For instance, "breislakite"...
Name a word that contains "slak" [!=quit, ?=hint] (8 left) unslakable
Totes! "unslakable" is found!
Name a word that contains "slak" [!=quit, ?=hint] (7 left) q
What is wrong with you?
Name a word that contains "slak" [!=quit, ?=hint] (7 left) !
Quitter!
Hey, you found 2 words! Not bad.

# Chapter 30: War

> The generation of random numbers is too important to be left to chance. -- Robert R. Coveyou

Create a Python program called `war.py` that plays the card game "War." The program will use the `random` module to shuffle a deck of cards, so your program will need to accept a `-s|--seed` argument (default: `None`) which you will use to call `random.seed`, if present.
 
First you program will need to create a deck of cards. You will need to use the Unicode symbols for the suites ( ♥ ♠ ♣ ♦ ) [which won't display in the PDF, so consult the Markdown file] and combine those with the numbers 2-10 and the letters "J", "Q," "K," and "A." (hint: look at `itertools.product`). 

````
>>> from itertools import product
>>> a = list('AB')
>>> b = range(2)
>>> list(product(a, b))
[('A', 0), ('A', 1), ('B', 0), ('B', 1)]
````

**NB**: You must sort your deck and then use the `random.shuffle` method so that your cards will be in the correct order to pass the tests!

In the real game of War, the cards are shuffled and then dealt one card each first to the non-dealer, then to the dealer, until all cards are dealt and each player has 26 cards. We will not be modeling this behavior. When writing your version of the game, simply `pop` two cards off the deck as the cards for player 1 and player 2, respectively. Compare the two cards by ignoring the suite and evaluating the value where 2 is the lowest and Aces are the highest. When two cards have the same values (e.g., two 5s or two Jacks), print "WAR!" In the real game, this initiates a sub-game of War which is a "recursive" algorithm which we will not bother modeling. Keep track of which player wins each round where no points are awarded in a tie. At the end, report the points for each player and state the winner. In the event of a tie, print "DRAW."

# Chapter 32: Hangman

Write a Python program called `hangman.py` that will play a game of Hangman which is a bit like "Wheel of Fortune" where you present the user with a number of elements indicating the length of a word. For our game, use the underscore `_` to indicate a letter that has not been guessed. The program should take `-n|--minlen` minimum length (default `5`) and `-l|--maxlen` maximum length options (default `10`) to indicate the minimum and maximum lengths of the randomly chosen word taken from the `-w|--wordlist` option (default `/usr/share/dict/words`). It also needs to take `-s|--seed` to for the random seed and the `-m|--misses` number of misses to allow the player.

To play, you will initiate an inifinite loop and keep track of the game state, e.g., the word to guess, the letters already guessed, the letters found, the number of misses. As this is an interactive game, I cannot write an test suite, so you can play my version and then try to write one like it. If the user guesses a letter that is in the word, replace the `_` characters with the letter. If the user guesses the same letter twice, admonish them. If the user guesses a letter that is not in the word, increment the misses and let them know they missed. If the user guesses too many times, exit the game and insult them. If they correctly guess the word, let them know and exit the game.

## Discussion

Let's start with a short look at `get_args` where I've decided to move the validation of the single `value` argument into this function rather than getting the arguments in `main` and checking there. We can use `argparse` to ensure the user provides an `int` value, but there's no `type` to say that it must be in our desired range; however, I can use the `parser.error` function on line 22 to trigger the normal fail-with-usage behaviour we normally get from `argparse`. From the standpoint of the calling code on line 32, all the work to coerce and validate the user happens in `get_args`. If we make it past line 32, then all must have been good and we can just focus on the task at hand.

I'd like to mention that I worked for a couple of days on this solution. I tried many different approaches before settling on the way I solved this problem, so what I do next may not be at all how you solved the problem. My idea was to find how many possible nickels, dimes, and quarters are in the given `value` and then find every combination of those values to see which ones sum to the `value` or less. To do this, I can use the `//` operator to find the integer division of the `value` by each of 5, 10, and 25 for nickels, dimes, and quarters, e.g.:

````
>>> value = 13
>>> value // 5
2
````

Finds there are two nickels in 13 cents. I construct a range that includes 0, 1, and 2 like so:

````
>>> nickels = range((value // 5) + 1)
>>> nickels
range(0, 3)
>>> list(nickels)
[0, 1, 2]
````

I used the `itertools.product` function and three ranges for nickels, dimes, and quarters to find every possible combination of every number of coins

````
>>> dimes = range((value // 10) + 1)
>>> quarters = range((value // 25) + 1)
>>> from itertools import product
>>> list(product(nickels, dimes, quarters))
[(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (2, 0, 0), (2, 1, 0)]
````

I want to include 0 of every coin so that I can make up the remainder in pennies. Let's jump ahead to the `figure` function to see how I wanted to use these values. Because `product` gives me a list of 3-tuples, I decided to pass `figure` the `value` and then a `coins` tuple that I unpack on line 66. I `sum` the values of the `nickels`, `dimes`, and `quarters` on line 67 and see if that is less than or equal to the `value`. If so, I get the number of pennies by subtracting the sum of the larger coins and return a 4-tuple with the number of each coin. If the previous sum was larger than the `value`, we don't bother defining the `return` of the function and so `None` is used.

Going back to line 37 where I want to call `figure` for each of the combinations returned by `product`, I use a list comprehension combined with a `map` which may seem rather dense but works quite well.  The `map` wants a function and a list of items to apply the function. There's a slight problem in that the `figure` function wants 2 arguments -- the `value` and the 3-tuple. I could have written the `map` using a `lambda`:

````
>>> def figure(value, coins):
...     nickels, dimes, quarters = coins
...     big_coins = sum([5 * nickels, 10 * dimes, 25 * quarters])
...     if big_coins <= value:
...         return (quarters, dimes, nickels, value - big_coins)
...
>>> list(map(lambda c: figure(value, c), product(nickels, dimes, quarters)))
[(0, 0, 0, 13), (0, 1, 0, 3), (0, 0, 1, 8), None, (0, 0, 2, 3), None]
````

But I thought it would be cleaner to create a partial application of the `figure` function with the `value` already bound. The `functools.partial` is exactly the tool we need and then we only need to pass in the 3-tuple of the coins:

````
>>> from functools import partial
>>> fig = partial(figure, value)
>>> fig((1,0,0))
(0, 0, 1, 8)
````

And so now I can use this `partial` function in my `map`:

````
>>> list(map(fig, product(nickels, dimes, quarters)))
[(0, 0, 0, 13), (0, 1, 0, 3), (0, 0, 1, 8), None, (0, 0, 2, 3), None]
````

Notice how we get some `None` values returned. Remember, this is because some of the combinations we are trying are too large, e.g., the maximum number of all the coins will be too large. So, to filter out those value, I can use a list comprehension with a guard at the end:

````
>>> combos = [c for c in map(fig, product(nickels, dimes, quarters)) if c]
>>> combos
[(0, 0, 0, 13), (0, 1, 0, 3), (0, 0, 1, 8), (0, 0, 2, 3)]
````

I could have used a `filter` for this, but it just doesn't seem to read as well:

````
>>> list(filter(lambda c: c, map(fig, product(nickels, dimes, quarters))))
[(0, 0, 0, 13), (0, 1, 0, 3), (0, 0, 1, 8), (0, 0, 2, 3)]
````

This is a list of 4-tuples representing the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies that will sum to `13`. We still need to report back to the user, so that is the purpose of the `fmt_combo` function. Given that 4-tuple, I want to report, e.g., "1 quarter" or "3 dimes", so I need to know the value of the denomination and the singular/plural versions of name of the denomination. I use the `zip` function to pair the coin denominations with their values:

````
>>> combo = (0, 0, 0, 13)
>>> list(zip(('quarter', 'dime', 'nickel', 'penny'), combo))
[('quarter', 0), ('dime', 0), ('nickel', 0), ('penny', 13)]
````

The `plural` version of each name is made by adding `s` except for `penny`, so line 53 handles that. If the denomination is not in the `combo` (e.g., here we have only pennies), then we skip those by using `if val` where `val` will be the number of coins. The integer value `0` will evaluate to `False` in a Boolean context, so only those with a non-zero value will be included. I decided to create a `list` of the strings for each denomination, so I `append` to that list the `val` plus the correct singular or plural version of the name, finally returning that list joined on comma-space (`', '`). 

Finally lines 39-43 are left to formatting the report to the user, being sure to provide feedback that includes the original `value` ("If you give me ...") and an enumerated list of all the possible ways we could make change. The test suite does not bother to check the order in which you return the combinations, only that the correct number are present and they are in the correct format.

# Chapter 34: Markov Chain

Write a Python program called `markov.py` that takes one or more text files as positional arguments for training. Use the `-n|--num_words` argument (default `2`) to find clusters of words and the words that follow them, e.g., in "The Bustle" by Emily Dickinson:

    The bustle in a house
    The morning after death
    Is solemnest of industries
    Enacted upon earth,—

    The sweeping up the heart,
    And putting love away
    We shall not want to use again
    Until eternity.

If `n=1`, then we find that "The" can be followed by "bustle," "morning," and "sweeping. There is a "the" followed by "heart," but we're not going to alter the text in any way, including removing punctuation, so just use `str.split` on the text to break up the words. 

To begin your text, choose a random word (or words) that begin with an uppercase letter. Then randomly select the next word in the chain, keep track of the floating window of the `-n` words, and keep selecting the next words until you have matched or exceeded the `-l|--length` argument of the number of characters (default 500) to emit at which point you should stop when you find a word that terminates with `.`, `!`, or `?`.

If you use `str.split` to get the words from the training text, you'll be removing any newlines from the text, so use a `-w|--text_width` argument (default 70) to introduce newlines in the output before the text exceeds that number of characters on the line.

Because of the use of randomness, you should include a `-s|--seed` argument (default `None`) to pass to `random.seed`.

Occassionally you may chose a path that terminates. That is, in selecting the next word, you may find there is no next-next word. In that case, just exit the program.

My implementation includes a `-d|--debug` option that will write a `.log` file so you can inspect my data structures and logic as you write your own version.

You should find many diverse texts and use them all as training files with varying numbers for `-n` to see how the texts will be mixed. The results are endlessly entertaining.

# Chapter 35: Hamming Chain

Write a Python program called `chain.py` that takes a `-s|--start` word and searches a `-w|--wordlist` argument (default `/usr/local/share/dict`) for words no more than `-d|--max_distance` Hamming distance for some number of `-i|--iteration` (default `20`). Be sure to accept a `-S|--seed` for `random.seed`. 

If the given word is not found in the word list, exit with an error and message. While searching for the next word in the chain, be sure not to repeat any words previously found or you might just go in circles! If you fail to find any new words before the end of the iterations, exit with an error and message as such.

# Chapter 36: Morse Encoder/Decoder

Write a Python program called `morse.py` that will encrypt/decrypt text to/from Morse code. The program should expect a single positional argument which is either the name of a file to read for the input or the character `-` to indicate reading from STDIN. The program should also take a `-c|--coding` option to indicate use of the `itu` or standard `morse` tables, `-o|--outfile` for writing the output (default STDOUT), and a `-d|--decode` flag to indicate that the action is to decode the input (the default is to encode it).

# Chapter 37: ROT13 (Rotate 13)

Write a Python program called `rot13.py` that will encrypt/decrypt input text by shifting the text by a given `-s|--shift` argument or will move each character halfway through the alphabet, e.g., "a" becomes "n," "b" becomes "o," etc. The text to rotate should be provided as a single positional argument to your program and can either be a text file, text on the command line, or `-` to indicate STDIN so that you can round-trip data through your program to ensure you are encrypting and decrypting properly.

The way I approached the solution is to think of adding time. If it's 8 in the morning and I want to know the time in 6 hours on a 12-hour (not military/24-hour) clock, I need to think in terms of 12 when the clock rolls over from AM to PM. To do that, I need to know the remainder of dividing by 12, which is given by the modulus `%` operator:

````
>>> now = 8
>>> (now + 6) % 12
2
````

And 6 hours from 8AM is, indeed, 2PM.

Similarly if I want to know how many hours (in decimal) are a particular number of minutes, I need to mod by 60:

````
>>> minutes = 90
>>> int(minutes / 60) + (minutes % 60) / 60
1.5
>>> minutes = 204
>>> int(minutes / 60) + (minutes % 60) / 60
3.4
````

If you `import string`, you can see all the lower/uppercase letters

````
>>> import string
>>> string.ascii_lowercase
'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
>>> string.ascii_uppercase
'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
````

So I think about "rot13" like adding 13 (or some other shift interval) to the position of the letter in the list and modding by the length of the list to wrap it around. If the shift is 13 and we are at "a" and want to know what the letter 13 way is, we can use `pos` to find "a" and add 13 to that:

````
>>> lcase = list(string.ascii_lowercase)
>>> lcase.index('a')
0
>>> lcase[lcase.index('a') + 13]
'n'
````

But if we want to know the value for something after the 13th letter in our list, we are in trouble!

````
>>> lcase[lcase.index('x') + 13]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
````

`%` to the rescue!

````
>>> lcase[(lcase.index('x') + 13) % len(lcase)]
'k'
````

It's not necessary in this algorithm to shift by any particular number. 13 is special because it's halfway through the alphabet, but we could shift by just 2 or 5 characters. If we want to round-trip our text, it's necessary to shift in the opposite direction on the second half of the trip, so be sure to use the negative value there!

# Chapter 38: Tranpose ABC Notation

Write a Python program called `transpose.py` that will read a file in ABC notation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_notation) and transpose the melody line up or down by a given `-s|--shift` argument. Like the `rot13` exercise, it might be helpful to think of the space of notes (`ABCDEFG`) as a list which you can roll through. For instance, if you have the note `c` and want to transpose up a (minor) third (`-s 3`), you would make the new note `e`; similarly if you have the note `F` and you go up a (major) third, you get `A`. You will not need to worry about the actual number of semitones that you are being asked to shift, as the previous example showed that we might be shifting by a major/minor/augmented/diminished/pure interval. The purpose of the exercise is simply to practice with lists.

efe edB | dBA ABd | efe edB | gdB ABd |
efe edB | d2d def | gfe edB |1 dBA ABd :|2 dBA AFD |]
</score>
````

If you use `new_py.py` to create your new program with the `file` as a single positional argument, you can use this code to get the input file and check that it is, indeed, a file:

````
args = get_args()
file = args.file

if not os.path.isfile(file):
    die('"{}" is not a file'.formate(file))
````

Now that you have a file, you can use a `for` loop to read it. Each line will still have a newline attached to the end, so you can use `rstrip()` to remove it:

````
for line in open(file):
    line = line.rstrip()
````

If a line starts with `<` and ends with `>` (cf. `str.startswith` and `str.endswith`), you can just print the line as-is. If the line starts with `K:`, then you have the key signature and should transpose it, e.g., if you have `K:A` and you are shifting a fifth, you should print `K:E`. If you have a line that starts with any other single uppercase letter and a colon, just print the line as-is. Finally, if you have a line that doesn't match any of the above conditions, you have a line of melody that needs to be transposed.

If you are unfamiliar with musical transposition, you may be a bit confused by the notion of a interval. A "second" equals a `--shift` of one note; that is, the distance from `A` to `B` is one note, but we call that a "second." Therefore, assume that the `--shift` argument is the name of the interval, e.g., `4` (a "fourth") is actually a move of three notes. That means the argument provided by the user should be in the range 2 to 8, inclusive, so complain if it is not. 

Note that the transposition of a tune up a fourth is the same as down a fifth:

## Discussion

The only argument to the program is a single positional `file` which I chose to define with `type=argparse.FileType('r')` on line 17 to save me the trouble of testing for a file though you could test yourself and will pass the test as long as your error message includes `No such file or directory: '{}'` for the given file.

### Reading the puzzle input

I chose to define a few additional functions while keeping most of the programs logic in the `main`. The first is `read_puzzle` that reads the file given by the user. As noted in the README, this file has the puzzle grid, an empty line, and then the list of words to search, so I define `read_puzzle` to accept the file (`fh`) as an argument and return two lists that represent the `puzzle` and `words` (line 28). 

There list of `words` is really most naturally represented as a `list` of `str` elements, but the `puzzle` is a bit more complicated. After working through a couple of solutions, I decided I would number all the characters in the grid in order to know which ones to reveal at the end and which ones to replace with a period, so I define a `cell` variable initialized to `0` to keep count of the characters. 

Here is my mental model of the puzzle:

	Puzzle			          Model
			 		  Col 0   Col 1   Col 2
	A B C	    Row	0 (A, 1)  (B, 2)  (C, 3)
	D E F       Row 1 (D, 4)  (E, 5)  (F, 6)
	G H I		Row 2 (G, 7)  (H, 8)  (I, 9)

Lastly, I need to know if I'm reading the first part of the file with the puzzle or the latter part with the words, so I define a `read` variable initialized to `'puzzle'` on line 30.

I start reading with `for line in` the file, but I want to chop off the trailing whitespace so I `map(str.rstrip, fh)`. Remember not to include parens `()` on `str.rstrip` as we want to *reference* the function not *call* it. The first operation in the loop is to check for an empty string (`''`, because we remove the newlines). If we find that, then we note the switch to reading the `'words'` and use `continue` to skip to the next iteration of the loop. 

If I'm reading the puzzle part of the file. then I want to read each character (line 38), increment the `cell` counter, then create a new tuple with the character and it's cell number, appending this to the `row`, a list to hold all the new tuples. The `row` then gets appended to the `puzzle` list that will eventually be a `list` of rows, each of which is a `list` of tuples representing `(char, cell)`. 

If we get to line 44, we must be reading the latter part of the file, so the `line` is actually a word that I will `append` to the `words` list. Before doing that, however, I will `replace` any space (`' '`) with the empty string (`''`) so as to remove spaces (cf. the `ice_cream.txt` input). Finally I `return puzzle, words` which is actually returning a tuple created by the comma `,` and which I immediately unpack on line 124.

### Finding all the strings

I always try to make a function fit into about 50 lines of code.  While my `read_puzzle` fits into 22 lines, the other function, `all_combos` is considerable longer. I couldn't find a way to shorten it, so I at least try to keep the idea fully contained to one function that, once it works, I no longer need to consider. The idea of this function is to find all the strings possible by reading each row, column, and diagonal both forward and backward. To do this, I first figure out how many rows and columns are present by checking the length (`len`) of the `puzzle` itself (the number of rows) and the length of the first row (the number of character in the first row). I double-check on line 56 that `all` of the the rows have the same `len` as the first one, using the `die` function from the `dire` module to print a message to STDERR and then `sys.exit(1)` to indicate a failure.

The `all_combos` will return a `list` of the characters and their cells, so I define `combos` on line 59 as an empty list (`[]`). Reading the rows is easiest on lines 61-62 as we just copy each `row` into `combo`. Reading the columns is done by moving from column `0` to the last column using the `range(num_cols)` (remembering the last number is not included which is important because if there are 10 columns then we need to move from column `0` to column `9`). I can then extract each column position from each row in the puzzle by indexing `puzzle[row_num][col_num]` and appending those to the `combos`.

The diagonals are the trickiest. I chose to go up (lower-left to upper-right) first. I start in the top-left corner, row `0` and column `0`. For each row, I'm going to move diagonally upwards (toward the top of the grid) which is actually counting *down* from the row I'm on, so I actually need to move `row_i` *up* and then `row_j` *down*. (I use `i` for "integer" and then `j` because "j" comes after "i". This is a typical naming convention. If I needed a third counter, I'd move to `k`.) I count `row_j` *down* by using `range(row_i, -1, -1)` (where the first `-1` is so I can count all the way to `0` and the second indicates the step should go down by one), I need to move the `col_num` over by `1`. If I successfully read a diagonal, I append that to the `combos`. 

The next block starts at the bottommost row of the and moves across the columns and is very similar to how I read the columns. Then moving into reading the diagonals in a downward (upper-left to bottom-right) fashion, I modified the other two blocks to handle the specifics. Finally at the end of the function (line 120), I want to `extend` the `combos` list by adding a `reversed` version of each combo. It's necessary to coerce `list(reversed(c))` otherwise we'd end up with references to `reversed` *objects*. 

### Solving the puzzle

Once we've read the puzzle and found all the possible strings both forwards and backwards, we can then look for each of the words in each of the strings. In my `main`, I want to use sets to note all the words that are `found` as well as the cell numbers to `reveal`. Because I'll be reading lists of tuples where the character is in the first position and the cell number in the second, I define two functions `fst` and `snd` (stolen from Haskell) that I can use in `map` expressions. I iterate `for word in words` (line 146) and `for combo in combos` to check all combinations. Recall that the `combo` is a list of tuples:

````
>>> combo = [('X', 1), ('F', 2), ('O', 3), ('O', 4)]
````

so I can build a string from the characters in the `fst` position of the tuples by mapping them to `fst`:

````
>>> list(map(fst, combo))
['X', 'F', 'O', 'O']
````

and joining them on an empty string:

````
>>> test = ''.join(map(fst, combo))
>>> test
'XFOO'
````

Then I check if the `word` is in the `test` string:

````
>>> word='FOO'
>>> word in test
True
````

If it is, then I can find where it starts with the `str.index` function:

````
>>> start = test.index(word)
>>> start
1
````

I know then end is:

````
>>> end = start + len(word)
>>> end
4
````

I can use that information to iterate over the elements in the `combo` to extract the cell numbers which are in the `snd` position of the tuple because ultimately what I need to print is the original puzzle grid with the cells showing the hidden words and all the others masked. I can extract a list slice using `combo[start:end]`, `map` those elements through `snd` to get the `cell` and `add` those to the `reveal` set. I can also note that I `found` the `word`.

At line 157, I start the work of printing the revealed puzzle, iterating over the original rows in the puzzle and over each cell in the row. If the cell number is in the `reveal` set, I chose the character (in the first position of the tuple); otherwise I use a period (`.`). Finally I note any missing words by looking to see if any of the original words were not in the `found` set.

# Appendix 1: argparse

The `argparse` module will interpret all the command-line arguments to your program. I suggest you use `argparse` for every command-line program you write so that you always have a standard way to get arguments and present help.

## Types of arguments

Command-line arguments come in a variety of flavors:

* Positional: The order and number of the arguments is what determines their meaning. Some programs might expect, for instance, a file name as the first argument and an output directory as the second. 
* Named options: Standard Unix format allows for a "short" name like `-f` (one dash and a single character) or a "long" name like `--file` (two dashes and a string of characters) followed by some value like a file name or a number. This allows for arguments to be provided in any order or not provided in which case the program can use a reasonable default value.
* Flag: A "Boolean" value like "yes"/"no" or `True`/`False` usually indicated by something that looks like a named option but without a value, e.g., `-d` or `--debug` to turn on debugging. Typically the presence of the flag indicates a `True` value for the argument; therefore, it's absence would mean `False`, so `--debug` turns *on* debugging while no `--debug` flag means there should not no debugging.

## Datatypes of values

The `argparse` module can save you enormous amounts of time by forcing the user to provide arguments of a particular type. If you run `new.py`, all of the above types of arguments are present along with suggestions for how to get string or integer values:

````
# --------------------------------------------------
def get_args():
    """Get command-line arguments"""

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description='Argparse Python script',
        formatter_class=argparse.ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter)

    parser.add_argument('positional',
                        metavar='str',
                        help='A positional argument')

    parser.add_argument('-a',
                        '--arg',
                        help='A named string argument',
                        metavar='str',
                        type=str,
                        default='')

    parser.add_argument('-i',
                        '--int',
                        help='A named integer argument',
                        metavar='int',
                        type=int,
                        default=0)

    parser.add_argument('-f',
                        '--flag',
                        help='A boolean flag',
                        action='store_true')

    return parser.parse_args()
````

You should change the `description` to a short sentence describing your program. The `formatter_class` argument tells `argparse` to show the default values in the the standard help documentation. 

The `positional` argument's definition indicates we expect exactly one positional argument. The `-a` argument's `type` must be a `str` while the `-i` option must be something that Python can convert to the `int` type (you can also use `float`). Both of these arguments have `default` values which means the user is not required to provide them. You could instead define them with `required=True` to force the user to provide values themselves.

The `-f` flag notes that the `action` is to `store_true` which means the value's default with be `True` if the argument is present and `False` otherwise. 

The `type` of the argument can be something much richer than simple Python types like strings or numbers. You can indicate that an argument must be a existing, readable file. Here is a simple implementation in Python of `cat -n`:

````
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Python version of `cat -n`"""

import argparse


# --------------------------------------------------
def get_args():
    """Get command-line arguments"""

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        description='Argparse Python script',
        formatter_class=argparse.ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter)

    parser.add_argument('file',
                        metavar='FILE',
                        type=argparse.FileType('r'),
                        help='Input file')

    return parser.parse_args()


# --------------------------------------------------
def main():
    """Make a jazz noise here"""

    args = get_args()
    fh = args.file

    print('Reading "{}"'.format(fh.name))
    for i, line in enumerate(fh):
        print(i, line, end='')


# --------------------------------------------------
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
````

The `type` of the input `file` argument is an *open file handle* which we can directly read line-by-line with a `for` loop! Because it's a file *handle* and not a file *name*, I chose to call the variable `fh` to help me remember what it is. You can access the file's name via `fh.name`. 

````

2 Is solemnest of industries
3 Enacted upon earth,--

5 The sweeping up the heart,
6 And putting love away
7 We shall not want to use again
8 Until eternity.
````

## Number of arguments

If you want one positional argument, you can define them like so:

````
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""One positional argument"""

import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
    description='One positional argument',
    formatter_class=argparse.ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter)

parser.add_argument('first', metavar='str', help='First argument')
args = parser.parse_args()
print('first =', args.first)
````

If the user provides anything other exactly one argument, they get a help message:

````
$ ./one_arg.py
usage: one_arg.py [-h] str
one_arg.py: error: the following arguments are required: str
$ ./one_arg.py foo bar
usage: one_arg.py [-h] str
one_arg.py: error: unrecognized arguments: bar
$ ./one_arg.py foo
first = foo
````

If you want two different positional arguments:

````
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Two positional arguments"""

import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
    description='Two positional arguments',
    formatter_class=argparse.ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter)

parser.add_argument('first', metavar='str', help='First argument')

parser.add_argument('second', metavar='int', help='Second argument')

return parser.parse_args()

print('first =', args.first)
print('second =', args.second)
````

Again, the user must provide exactly this number of positional arguments:

````
$ ./two_args.py
usage: two_args.py [-h] str str
two_args.py: error: the following arguments are required: str, str
$ ./two_args.py foo
usage: two_args.py [-h] str str
two_args.py: error: the following arguments are required: str
$ ./two_args.py foo bar
first = foo
second = bar
````

You can also use the `nargs=N` option to specify some number of arguments. It only makes sense if the arguments are the same thing like two files:

````
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""nargs=2"""

import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
    description='nargs=2',
    formatter_class=argparse.ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter)

parser.add_argument('files', metavar='FILE', nargs=2, help='Two files')

args = parser.parse_args()

file1, file2 = args.files
print('file1 =', file1)
print('file2 =', file2)
````

The help indicates we want two files:

````
$ ./nargs2.py foo
usage: nargs2.py [-h] FILE FILE
nargs2.py: error: the following arguments are required: FILE
````

And we can unpack the two file arguments and use them:

````
$ ./nargs2.py foo bar
file1 = foo
file2 = bar
````

If you want one or more of some argument, you can use `nargs='+'`:

````
$ cat nargs+.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""nargs=+"""

import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
    description='nargs=+',
    formatter_class=argparse.ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter)

parser.add_argument('files', metavar='FILE', nargs='+', help='Some files')

args = parser.parse_args()
files = args.files

print('number = {}'.format(len(files)))
print('files  = {}'.format(', '.join(files)))
````

Note that this will return a `list` -- even a single argument will become a `list` of one value:

````
$ ./nargs+.py
usage: nargs+.py [-h] FILE [FILE ...]
nargs+.py: error: the following arguments are required: FILE
$ ./nargs+.py foo
number = 1
files  = foo
$ ./nargs+.py foo bar
number = 2
files  = foo, bar
````

## Choices

Sometimes you want to limit the values of an argument. You can pass in a `list` of valid values to the `choices` option. 

````
$ cat appendix/argparse/choices.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Choices"""

import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
    description='Choices',
    formatter_class=argparse.ArgumentDefaultsHelpFormatter)

parser.add_argument('color', metavar='str', help='Color', choices=['red', 'yellow', 'blue'])

args = parser.parse_args()

print('color =', args.color)
````

Any value not present in the list will be rejected and the user will be shown the valid choices:

````
$ ./choices.py
usage: choices.py [-h] str
choices.py: error: the following arguments are required: str
$ ./choices.py purple
usage: choices.py [-h] str
choices.py: error: argument str: invalid choice: 'purple' (choose from 'red', 'yellow', 'blue')
````

## Automatic help

The `argparse` module reserves the `-h` and `--help` flags for generating help documentation. You do not need to add these nor are you allowed to use these flags for other purposes. Using the above definition, this is the help that `argparse` will generate:

````
$ ./foo.py
usage: foo.py [-h] [-a str] [-i int] [-f] str
foo.py: error: the following arguments are required: str
[cholla@~/work/python/playful_python/article]$ ./foo.py -h
usage: foo.py [-h] [-a str] [-i int] [-f] str

Argparse Python script

positional arguments:
  str                A positional argument

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -a str, --arg str  A named string argument (default: )
  -i int, --int int  A named integer argument (default: 0)
  -f, --flag         A boolean flag (default: False)
````

Notice how unhelpful a name like `positional` is? 

## Getting the argument values

The values for the arguments will be accessible through the "long" name you define and will have been coerced to the Python data type you indicated. If I change `main` to this:

````
# --------------------------------------------------
def main():
    """Make a jazz noise here"""

    args = get_args()
    str_arg = args.arg
    int_arg = args.int
    flag_arg = args.flag
    pos_arg = args.positional

    print('str_arg = "{}" ({})'.format(str_arg, type(str_arg)))
    print('int_arg = "{}" ({})'.format(int_arg, type(int_arg)))
    print('flag_arg = "{}" ({})'.format(flag_arg, type(flag_arg)))
    print('positional = "{}" ({})'.format(pos_arg, type(pos_arg)))
````

And then run it:

````
$ ./foo.py -a foo -i 4 -f bar
str_arg = "foo" (<class 'str'>)
int_arg = "4" (<class 'int'>)
flag_arg = "True" (<class 'bool'>)
positional = "bar" (<class 'str'>)
````

Notice how we might think that `-f` takes the argument `bar`, but it is defined as a `flag` and the `argparse` knows that the program take

````
$ ./foo.py foo -a bar -i 4 -f
str_arg = "bar" (<class 'str'>)
int_arg = "4" (<class 'int'>)
flag_arg = "True" (<class 'bool'>)
positional = "foo" (<class 'str'>)
````

# Appendix 2: Truthiness

While it would seem Python has an actual Boolean (Yes/No, True/False) type, this idea can be seriously abused in many odd and confusing ways. First off, there are actual `True` and `False` values:

````
>>> True == True
True
>>> False == False
True
````

But they are equivalent to integers:

````
>>> True == 1
True
>>> False == 0
True
````

Which means, oddly, that you can add them:

````
>>> True + True
2
>>> True + True + False
2
````

Lots of things are `False`-ey when they are evaluated in a Boolean context. The `int` `0`, the `float` `0.0`, the empty string, an empty list, and the special value `None` are all considered `False`-ey:

````
>>> 'Hooray!' if 0 else 'Shucks!'
'Shucks!'
>>> 'Hooray!' if 0. else 'Shucks!'
'Shucks!'
>>> 'Hooray!' if [] else 'Shucks!'
'Shucks!'
>>> 'Hooray!' if '' else 'Shucks!'
'Shucks!'
>>> 'Hooray!' if None else 'Shucks!'
'Shucks!'
````

But note:

````
>>> 'Hooray!' if 'None' else 'Shucks!'
'Hooray!'
````

There are quotes around `'None'` so it's the literal string "None" and not the special value `None`, and, since this is not an empty string, it evaluates *in a Boolean context* to not-`False` which is basically `True`.

This behavior can introduce extremely subtle logical bugs into your programs that the Python compiler and linters cannot uncover. Consider the `dict.get` method that will safely return the value for a given key in a dictionary, returning `None` if the key does not exist. Given this dictionary:

````
>>> d = {'foo': 0, 'bar': None}
````

If we access a key that doesn't exist, Python generates an exception that, if not caught in our code, would immediately crash the program:

````
>>> d['baz']
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: 'baz'
````

But we can use `d.get()` to do this safely:

````
>>> d.get('baz')
````

Hmm, that seems unhelpful! What did we get back?

````
>>> type(d.get('baz'))
<class 'NoneType'>
````

Ah, we got `None`! 

We could use an `or` to define a default value:

````
>>> d.get('baz') or 'NA'
'NA'
````

It turns out the `get` method accepts a second, optional argument of the default value to return:

````
>>> d.get('baz', 'NA')
'NA'
````

Great! So let's use that on the other values:

````
>>> d.get('foo', 'NA')
0
>>> d.get('bar', 'NA')
````

The call for `bar` returned nothing because we put an actual `None` as the value:

````
>>> type(d.get('bar', 'NA'))
<class 'NoneType'>
````

The key `bar` didn't fail because that key exists in the dictionary. The `dict.get` method only returns the second, default argument *if the key does not exist in the dictionary* which is entirely different from checking the *value* of the key in the dictionary. OK, so we go back to this:

````
>>> d.get('bar') or 'NA'
'NA'
````

Which seems to work, but notice this:

````
>>> d.get('foo') or 'NA'
'NA'
````

The value for `foo` is actually `0` which evaluates to `False` given the Boolean evaluation of the `or`. If this were a measurement of some value like the amount of sodium in water, then the string `NA` would indicate that no value was recorded whereas `0` indicates that sodium was measured and none detected. If some sort of important analysis rested on our interpretation of the strings in a spreadsheet, we might inadvertently introduce missing values because of the way Python coerces various non-Boolean values into Boolean values.

Perhaps a safer way to access these values would be:

````
>>> for key in ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']:
...   val = d[key] if key in d else 'NA'
...   val = 'NA' if val is None else val
...   print(key, val)
...
foo 0
bar NA
baz NA
````

# Appendix 3: File Handles

A file's name is a string like `'nobody.txt'`. To read or write the contents of the file, you need a *file handle* which you can get from `open`. Think of a file name as the address of your house. It's where your house can be found, but I can't know what's in your house unless I go there and open the door. That's what `open` does -- it finds the file's bits on disk and opens the door to read or write the file.

## File Modes

By default, a file is opened in *read* mode which means that it can't be altered. Also, the default is to open for reading *text*.  The only required argument to `open` is the file name, but a second optional argument is a combination of characters to explain how to open the file. From the documentation for `open`:

````
========= ===============================================================
Character Meaning
--------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
'r'       open for reading (default)
'w'       open for writing, truncating the file first
'x'       create a new file and open it for writing
'a'       open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists
'b'       binary mode
't'       text mode (default)
'+'       open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)
'U'       universal newline mode (deprecated)
========= ===============================================================
````

So if you do:

````
fh = open('out.txt')
````

It's the same as doing:

````
fh = open('out.txt', 'wt')
````

Where the combination of `wt` means `write text`. We can also read and write raw bits in `binary`, e.g., if you wanted to read the bit values of the pixels in an image.

I always make a distinction in the variable names for the `file` or `filename` and the *file handle* which I usually call `fh` if there's just one or maybe `in_fh` and `out_fh` if there is one for reading and one for writing, etc.

## STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR

Unix has three standard files or channels called *standard in*, *standard out*, and *standard error* which are normally written as STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR. When you `print`, the default is that the text goes to STDOUT which you see in your terminal or REPL.

The `print` function takes some optional keyword arguments, one of which is `file` which has the default value of `sys.stdout`. If you wish to `print` to *standard error* (STDERR), you can use the `sys.stderr` file:

````
print('This is an error!', file=sys.stderr)
````

Note that you *do not* have to `open` these two special file handles. They are always available to you. 

If you wish to write to a file on disc, you can `open` a file for writing and pass that:

````
print('This is an error!', file=open('error.txt', 'wt'))
````

Note that if each time you `open` a file for writing, you overwrite any existing data. If you wanted to `print` repeatedly in a program, you would either need to `open` in append mode:

````
print('This is an error!', file=open('error.txt', 'at'))
print('This is an also error!', file=open('error.txt', 'at'))
````

Or, better yet, `open` the file at the beginning of the program, `print` as often as you like, and then `close` the file:

````
fh = open('out.txt', 'wt')
print('Writing some text.', file=fh)
print('Adding more text.', file=fh)
fh.close()
````

Or use the `write` method of the file handle:

````
fh = open('out.txt', 'wt')
fh.write('Writing some text.\n')
fh.write('Adding more text.\n')
fh.close()
````

Note that `print` automatically adds a newline to the end of the text whereas `write` does not so you need to add it yourself.

You can only *read* from STDIN. Again, you do not need to `open` it as it is always available. Treat it exactly like a file handle you've opened for reading, e.g., to read lines from STDIN until you recieve EOF (end of file):

````
for line in sys.stdin:
````

# Appendix 4: Markov Chains

Read about Markov chains:

* Claude Shannon's 1948 MS thesis, "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x)
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain 
* Chapter 3 of _The Practice of Programming_ by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike where they discuss implementations in C, C++, Java, awk, and Perl
* "Computer Recreations", A. K. Dewdney, Scientific American, 1989 (https://archive.org/details/ComputerRecreationsMarkovChainer)

I'd like you to consider how a Markov chain creates a graph structure. Consult the three PDFs (generated by the `mk-graphs.sh` program) that visualize the graphs created by k-mer sizes of 1, 2, 3, and 4 when given this input:

````
$ cat words.txt
maamselle
mabi
mabolo
mac
macaasim
macabre
````

Notice that sometimes the branches terminate and sometimes you can find multiple paths through the graphs. As `k` grows, there are fewer options.
