# Markov Chain

Write a Python program called `markov.py` that takes one or more text files as positional arguments for training. Use the `-n|--num_words` argument (default `2`) to find clusters of words and the words that follow them, e.g., in "The Bustle" by Emily Dickinson:

    The bustle in a house
    The morning after death
    Is solemnest of industries
    Enacted upon earth,—

    The sweeping up the heart,
    And putting love away
    We shall not want to use again
    Until eternity.

If `n=1`, then we find that "The" can be followed by "bustle," "morning," and "sweeping. There is a "the" followed by "heart," but we're not going to alter the text in any way, including removing punctuation, so just use `str.split` on the text to break up the words. 

To begin your text, choose a random word (or words) that begin with an uppercase letter. Then randomly select the next word in the chain, keep track of the floating window of the `-n` words, and keep selecting the next words until you have matched or exceeded the `-l|--length` argument of the number of characters (default 500) to emit at which point you should stop when you find a word that terminates with `.`, `!`, or `?`.

If you use `str.split` to get the words from the training text, you'll be removing any newlines from the text, so use a `-w|--text_width` argument (default 70) to introduce newlines in the output before the text exceeds that number of characters on the line.

Because of the use of randomness, you should include a `-s|--seed` argument (default `None`) to pass to `random.seed`.

Occassionally you may chose a path that terminates. That is, in selecting the next word, you may find there is no next-next word. In that case, just exit the program.

My implementation includes a `-d|--debug` option that will write a `.log` file so you can inspect my data structures and logic as you write your own version.

You should find many diverse texts and use them all as training files with varying numbers for `-n` to see how the texts will be mixed. The results are endlessly entertaining.
